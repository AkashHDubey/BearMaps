This project is my solution to the bearmaps project of UC berkeley's CS 61B.

The required additional data for the project and the princeton library:

Note:      
The code for project 2D is not optimized as per the recommended requirements.    
The code is also not checked by the autograder but it was able to pass every given test in the skeleton code locally.
